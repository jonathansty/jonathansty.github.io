<h2>Description</h2>
Team up with your friends or battle against your friends for the fastest time! It's up to you! In "Just the Two Of Us" both is possible. 2 Players team up to finish the level time trial as quick as possible. But beware! A giant evil quickly closes in on the players, hit all objectives while staying in range of each other to keep the evil at bay.

This game was made during a gamejam called <strong>"Brain's Eden 2016"</strong>, a 48 hours game jam in Cambridge, UK. The game jam was themed around "Parity". Having a theme for a gamejam really helps with guiding people in the right direction.

The university college, <strong>Howest</strong>, sent 2 teams to compete: <strong>The Dangerous arcade Elitists</strong> and <strong>DA Eden</strong>. I was competing as a member of DA Eden. The game ended up as a honorable mention decided by the unity judges.
