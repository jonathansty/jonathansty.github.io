# Summary
Geometry shader created with HLSL in a framework provided by Howest (overlord). The framework is programmed in
c++ using the DirectX api. Everything is built from scratch: gui, rendering, geometry generation. The
algorithm is based on marching cubes but adjusted to marching tetrahedra for use within HLSL.

I first prototyped metacirces in 2D to understand the mathematical concepts. You can find links to both applications below.


# Technical Details
- Engine: Overlord Engine ( DAE )
- Language: C++
- Graphics API: DirectX 11
- Version Control: Git

# Research

This application was part of the module Graphics Programming 2 of DAE. 
We were tasked for creating a geometry shader using 
the DirectX 11 and the DirectX 11 effects framework. 
This really thought me a lot what to do and 
what not to do in graphics programming (mostly what not to do).
Iâ€™ve also written a paper highlighting my research.
