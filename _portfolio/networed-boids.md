# Summary
This networked boid simulation is to show of the skills Iâ€™ve learned during that semester. The simulation itself is very unoptimized and brute. It does not do anything smart like partioning the space or distributing it over multiple cores. The goal was to learn about sockets programming and implement this in a realtime application.
