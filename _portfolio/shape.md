description: "
A 5-man team effort: 2 programmers and 3 artists combined their powers to make a fully finished and polished product. 
The result is a fresh mobile game called Shape. We decided to keep the idea simple and the game addicting. 
I programmed all of the UI, its functionality and its animations, 
the menu and the general game flow (pausing, resuming, interface switching, ..)
 made the UI scalable across platforms, player controls (gyroscope, slider and keyboard controls),
  implemented the store and skin buying/switching system, sound managing system, etc."
