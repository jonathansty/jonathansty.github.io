# Post-mortem
This was the first full application that I wrote using C++. The biggest challenge was learning how to use C++ and getting into the mindset of problem solving. It taught me
how a programming language is merely a tool that can be used but the ideas can transfer across multiple disciplines.

This application was part of the Programming 2 module of DAE(Digital Arts and Entertainment). The goal was to recreate an existing 2D platformer game with interesting mechanics. The reason I chose Electronic Super Joy was because the player interaction is so limited but it still has so much to offer and I really wanted to make the animations in code.
All of the death animations, explosions, checkpoint displayed are being created and animated in code.
