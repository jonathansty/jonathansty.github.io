## Biography
I am a game programmer currently based in the UK. Started my games career in 2017. Before that I was a student at Howest following the digital arts & entertainment trajectory with a focus on game development. 
Overtime I've ended up working mostly on graphics but enjoy working on general tooling, graphics and engine systems of video games.

## Current Role & Employer
Rendering Engineer @ Playground Games

## Skills
Technical skills include:
* Modern C++ (C++11 and onwards), C, C#, Rust
* Working with custom in-house engines since 2018
* Knowledge on how to debug and profile games (using RenderDoc, Pix, Nvidia Nsight)
* Console development (xbox)
* Version Control (Git, P4)
* Scripting languages such as Python and Lua.
* Node.js & Javascript for internal web tooling
* Prototyping experience in Unreal and Unity

\\
Aside from practical tech skills during my career I've been responsible for:
* Accurately planning and delivering features
* Writing technical documents 
* Presenting work to the wider team
* Communicating, planning and taking ownership of larger areas of the tech stack.



## Experience
`March 2019-Present`
__Playground Games,__   
__Rendering Engineer__  

*Fable*

Responsible for delivering and implementing various new features for the fable project, general improvements to address outstanding tech debt and taking over/owning existing systems that come over from the horizon team. 
I'm also responsible for effectively communicating and planning several engine layer rendering systems. 

*Forza Horizon 5*

For a brief amount of time I was put in the Horizon team. Close to shipping they needed some extra capacity to help profiling and fix bugs. Profiling was mainly targeted at the lower end platforms such as xbox one (durango).



`March 2018-July 2019`
__TT Games,__   
__Render Tech Programmer__  
Working on the engine rendering team to improve artists workflow and implement new features. There is a heavy focused on the rendering aspect and a less heavy focus on the tools side as a render tech programmer, this in turn requires me to understand the inner workings of the engines rendering model.
I also carry the responsibility of properly planning tasks and making sure features get delivered on time. 

Other focus points are:
   * Ensuring stability on new features and already existing features
   * Communicating changes to the teams
   * Writing multithreaded code and memory safe code

`Feb 2017 to March 2018`
__Studio Gobo Brighton,__  
__Generalist Programmer (Core & Render tech)__  

In Studio Gobo Brighton (later called Electric Square) I had the chance to explore a couple of different roles. 
The first 6 months I was interning there as part of my education of [Digital Arts and Entertainment][DAE]. 
Afterwards Studio Gobo offered me a full time position.

Below is a rough overview of the things I usually worked on (all of this is in a custom fork of UE4):
- Continuous integration and automated testing
- Performance Testing and planning
- Improving already existing UE4 technologies to fit our use cases
- Implementing game systems related to rendering
- Implementing tools for debug and artists pipelines 
- Adjusting lightmass to fit the needs of the project
