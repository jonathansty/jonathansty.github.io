## Experience
`March 2018-Now`
__TT Games,__   
__Render Tech Programmer__  
Working on the engine rendering team to improve artists workflow and implement new features. There is a heavy focused on the rendering aspect and a less heavy focus on the tools side as a render tech programmer, this in turn requires me to understand the inner workings of the engines rendering model.
I also carry the responsibility of properly planning tasks and making sure features get delivered on time. 

Other focus points are:
   * Ensuring stability on new features and already existing features
   * Communicating changes to the teams
   * Writing multithreaded code and memory safe code
