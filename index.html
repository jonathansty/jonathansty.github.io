I'm a belgian born games programmer that is interested in graphics, engines and low-level programming.  
  
Since 2016 I've been gradually getting into software and game development and have been working in games full-time since early 2017. My first full-time job was at Studio Gobo as a generalist programmer where I ended up doing UE4 engine side related work. Eventually I moved on to work for Traveller's Tales as a render tech programmer for engine tech.
